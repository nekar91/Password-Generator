This homework assignment was very difficult.  I used the code I thought was best from class activities and Google searches.

I am not clear on when and how to create variables outside of stated variables/arrays.  I know that variables other than those need to 
created in the course of using JavaScript, but I have not figured out exactly when.  As you can see, my variables are a mess.

Part of this is that I am extremely sleep-deprived at this point due to staying up late to work on homework and studying.  I have struggled to meet the time management requirements for this course, but I have a plan to better manage my time in the future.  

I understand the concepts taught in class, but getting those concepts down in code, especially in JavaScript, is another story!
